Project Context:
This academic project focuses on building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based chatbot.
The chatbot is designed to answer academic questions using lecture PDFs, PowerPoint slides,
and profile-based academic information. The system retrieves relevant context from stored
documents and uses an AI language model only for answer generation.

Usage Guidelines:
The chatbot should respond strictly based on the provided academic documents and profile
information. If a question is outside the available context, the chatbot should clearly state
that the information is not available.
